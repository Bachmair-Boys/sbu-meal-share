# sbu-meal-share

This is an app that allows Stony Brook students to order and deliver meals from dining halls. Students who wish to order a meal create an order specifying the dining hall from which they wish to eat and the pickup location where they meet the deliverer. Students who wish to deliver a meal can check in to a dining hall and view orders from that hall. Once the deliverer chooses and order, a chatbox opens allowing the deliverer and orderer to work out the remaining details of their order.
